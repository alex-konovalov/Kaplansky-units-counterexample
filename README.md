# Kaplansky-units-counterexample

We follow the proof by Giles Gardam in "A counterexample to the unit conjecture for group rings"
(https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11818) and provide an independent verification of the calculations in GAP.

Click on "launch binder" button to start a Jupyter notebook in which you will be able to
follow the steps of the calculation.

This repository uses the template for publishing reproducible GAP experiments in Jupyter
notebooks runnable on Binder, available at https://github.com/rse-standrewscs/gap-binder-template.
